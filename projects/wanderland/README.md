### Screenery

| Node | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Alicia's ownership | Alicia owns Screenery materials/supply: foam padding, glue, sheets stock. | active; detail TBD |
| AI designer | An AI folder/project for editing Illustrator (.ai) files. | active; see below |
| AI designer → finalize file checklist | Checklist to finalize a design file. | needs detail |
| AI designer → file ledger | Per-design ledger: final set list, artboards/sheets breakdown, production notes. | needs detail |
| AI designer → assembly manual | Assembly manual/instructions, one per design. | needs detail |
| Orders | Existing and incoming client orders. | active; detail TBD |

(Inference, unconfirmed: Screenery is a physical product built from glued foam padding + sheet stock — implied by the materials list.)

**Access** (granted 2026-06-02): permitted to read these folders **when relevant** — do not pre-load or let them inform work until a task calls for it. `~/Documents` is Drive-synced — read-only, no folder moves/renames.

- `~/Documents/screenery-lean` — current working folder.
- `~/Documents/Master Screenery 3.5` — previous project; reference only.

### Wanderland — other

| Node | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Chinese manufacturer / distributor partnership | Manufacturing / distribution partnership in China. | needs detail |
| Other → Joff (Stir / Hilton) | Joff, associated with Stir / Hilton. | needs detail |
| Other → EquipHotel | EquipHotel. (Likely the Paris hospitality trade fair — low confidence, unconfirmed.) | needs detail |

## Dashboard

Visual tree (markmap — interactive collapse/zoom). Navigable nodes only; no access info.

- Source (edit this): [dashboard/wanderland.tree.md](../../dashboard/wanderland.tree.md)
- Generated view (open in browser): `dashboard/wanderland.html` — self-contained, offline.
- Regenerate after editing the source:
  ```bash
  npx -y markmap-cli dashboard/wanderland.tree.md -o dashboard/wanderland.html --offline --no-open
  ```

## Open questions

- Confirm Screenery one-line definition (physical product from foam + sheets?).
- AI designer — where does it live (folder/repo path), what does the workflow do?
- Orders — where tracked (file, sheet, system)?
- Scope of the Chinese manufacturer/distributor partnership (stage, counterpart, deliverable)?
- Who is Joff; what is the Stir / Hilton angle?
- EquipHotel — confirm what it is and Wanderland's involvement.
